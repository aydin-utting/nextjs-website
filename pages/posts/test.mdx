:wave: :car: :smile:

This is definitely possible.
All I need now is to create a folder with all the MDX files, and a way to turn them into seperate pages with a [slug].js blog posts file.
Then I need some scripts to run through the metadata and get the dates and make the lists for the summary views.

I think ideally there would be a componenent which is a blog post summary with the title in one div the "absract" in another and the published date.

and then I could reuse this depending on what view i am in, big cards? small list on homepage?
