# My Next.js Website

This is a personal project, currently in beta. I will be turning this into a proper hosted website soon.

I'm currently teaching myself React and this is a fun way to learn.

The plan is for the website to include:
* A blog with a tagging system built with MDX.
* A CV page with contact details.
* A React/javascript "playground" page where I can mess about with CSS and React.
